We're excited to announce our ZZ Example Solve Library!
It's a collection of solves from the best ZZ solvers for learning and inspiration.

## Why do we need example solves?

No matter if you use CFOP, Roux or ZZ, example solves are an essential resource to improve as a cuber.
Solutions, fingertricks and techniques can get complicated because there are so many ways to do the same thing.
Example solves show you how highly skilled cubers approach it.

Unfortunately, ZZ has always had a lack of example solves.
There aren't a lot of ZZ users, and the method has evolved a lot in the past 5 years.
It's hard to find solves using recent trends such as EOCross and ZBLL.

## What is ZZ Example Solve Library?

[Example Solve Library](/example-solves) is a new section on this website dedicated to ZZ solve reconstructions.
Each collection of solves includes a video and a full, move-by-move breakdown of the solutions.
For example, this is what a solve by Yoruba looks like:

<br />

<ReconViewer recon={RECONS[15]} index={15} />

## Yoruba's 7.19 Ao50

We're launching the Library with 50 solves from Yoruba, the fastest ZZ user and author of the [Improvement Guide](/improvement-guide).
