Welcome to our collection of modern ZZ solves!
Example solves are an essential learning resource for any method.
You can see real-world examples of:
- Finger tricks
- EOCross solutions
- F2L solutions and pair choice
- LL algs and execution

All of our solves are filmed at a suitable camera angle and reconstructed move-by-move.
Some include helpful notes and alternative solutions by the solvers themselves.
The reconstructions are brought to life with 3D animations by [`cubing.js`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/twisty/).

## Collections

We currently have 60 solves from Yoruba and Gen, check them out!
